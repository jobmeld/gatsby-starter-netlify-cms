description: The islands of French Polynesia are some of the most beautiful in
  the world! If you’re getting ready for a trip to Tahiti, Mo’orea, Bora Bora or
  another island, here’s a packing list of some things we found useful on our
  trip.
listitems:
  - itemname: Lots of swimsuits!
    description: You will spend most of your time in the water so bring several swimsuits!
  - itemname: Sunscreen, sunscreen, and more sunscreen
    description: The sun here is intense, and sunscreen is expensive to buy on the
      Islands, so bring more than you think you’ll need. Using reef-safe
      sunscreen is also recommended to protect coral reefs and marine life.

  - itemname: Sun Hat
    description: As we said, the sun is intense, you’ll want to keep your head and
      face protected. We like foldable hats that pack easily in our suitcases
      like this one.

  - itemname: Rain jacket or umbrella
    description: "It often rains on the Islands, especially if you take an excursion
      inland. A lightweight rain jacket will keep you comfortable and dry.
      Packable jackets fold up small and won’t take up much room in your
      suitcase. "

  - itemname: Water shoes
    description: If you swim from your bungalow, you’ll be jumping right into the
      reef so you’ll want water shoes to protect your feet from sharp coral.
      They are also great for walking on hot sand.

  - itemname: Snorkel and mask
    description: Some resorts and excursions will rent snorkel gear to you, but we
      prefer to bring our own, so we know it’s clean and fits well. You don’t
      want to deal with a leaking or foggy mask when there are so many fish and
      corals to see!

  - itemname: Underwater camera
    description: After seeing how amazing the underwater world is, you will want to
      share it on your social media! We use a GoPro with a dome attachment to
      get those above and below the water shots.

  - description: Blow up a pool float to lounge in the water when you’re ready to
      relax after all that snorkeling. We saw some pretty elaborate floats like
      flamingos and diamond rings but keep in mind these are almost impossible
      to deflate and fit back in your suitcase, and you’ll likely gift it to
      some new resort friends. We like to buy ours during an end-of-summer
      clearance sale, so we don’t feel bad about leaving them behind. Don’t
      forget the fun drink floats too! You might also want to bring some rope to
      tie your float to your bungalow, so you don’t drift away.
    itemname: Inflatable pool floats

  - itemname: Resort clothes
    description: You will spend most of your time in your swimsuits, so you don’t
      need to pack that many outfits. A few t-shirts and pairs of shorts, and a
      couple of cover-ups will get you through the days. For dinner and
      evenings, casual dresses for ladies and linen shirts or polos and shorts
      for men are all you need, most places aren’t too dressy. If you’re
      celebrating an occasion or just prefer dressing nice for dinner, go for
      it! You won’t feel out of place, you will see a variety of dress options
      here, so wear what makes you happy!
  - itemname: Not much jewelry
    description: What you won’t need is a lot of shoes or jewelry. Ladies, leave
      high heels at home, it’s tough walking on the boardwalks with them. I like
      to bring an essential pool sandal for the day and a nicer neutral color
      sandal for the evening that will match all my dresses. For jewelry, it’s
      recommended not to wear anything shiny in the water because it could
      attract sharks! You also don’t want to risk losing anything in the water,
      so it’s best to leave them at home or in your room safe. We usually wear
      silicone rings during the day.
  - itemname: Evening Entertainment
    description: French Polynesia is located near the equator, so sunset is between
      5:30 pm and 6:30 pm during the year. You’ll be tired from swimming all
      day, but you want to bring something to stay entertained at night since it
      gets dark so early. Keep it simple, like a deck of cards or Uno, an iPad
      to watch movies, or a Firestick to plug into the tv in your room. Also,
      we’d recommend bringing a small flashlight to use walking to and from
      dinner since it’s pretty dark walking back to your bungalow. A small
      citronella candle is also lovely if you’re relaxing on your deck to keep
      the mosquitos away.

  - description: Stay hydrated and keep your water cold with a reusable water
      bottle! Check out the resort gym for an easy place to refill your water
      bottle. Insulated cups are also lovely for enjoying other beverages too!
    itemname: Water bottle or insulated cup
