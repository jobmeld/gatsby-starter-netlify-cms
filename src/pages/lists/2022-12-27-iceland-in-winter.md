description: "Iceland has become a really popular travel destination, and it has
  its perks for visiting in each season. If you’re planning to visit in winter,
  the key to staying warm and comfortable is layers! "
listitems:
  - itemname: Wind and Waterproof Jacket
    description: While the winter temperatures in Iceland usually average 32°F, it’s
      the wind that makes it feel much colder. We like to wear a Gore-Tex outer
      layer to protect against wind and water, and a lightweight, packable
      jacket takes up less room in your suitcase. We typically layer this over
      an insulated puffer coat or other layers depending on the temperature, but
      you could also wear a 3-in-1 coat as all your layers. Keep in mind that
      these jackets are usually bulkier, so you may end up just wearing it on
      the airplane.

  - itemname: Insulated Jacket
    description: Under the Gore-Tex, an insulated jacket will reduce core heat loss
      to keep you warm. Most insulated jackets pack down pretty small within
      their own pocket or small stuff sack, so these are easy for traveling!

  - itemname: Fleece Jacket or Wool Sweater
    description: Depending on the weather, layering a fleece jacket adds extra
      warmth. You could also save room in your suitcase and buy a traditional
      Icelandic wool sweater during your trip!

  - itemname: Windproof Pants
    description: You’ll want to protect your legs from the weather as well. Jeans
      take a long time to dry when they get wet, so we recommend wind or
      waterproof pants as a top layer.

  - itemname: Wool Base-layer

    description: "Underneath all the layers above, a wool base layer is best to wear
      against your skin since it’s soft and insulated, odor resistant, and
      moisture-wicking. Fleece base layers also work well but do retain
      odors.  "

  - itemname: Wool socks
    description: Keep your toes warm! Same as your base layer, wool socks will keep
      your feet insulated and moisture free. Cotton absorbs moisture and takes
      longer to dry so avoid wearing cotton socks, wool will keep you way more
      comfortable!

  - itemname: Waterproof boots
    description: We recommend hiking boots or snow boots with good tread so you
      won’t slip on snow or ice. If you buy new boots, make sure to break them
      in before your trip since you’ll be doing a lot of walking.

    description: You lose most of your body heat through your head and neck so keep
      them covered with a warm hat and scarf. For gloves, we recommend
      touchscreen compatibility since you’ll probably be taking lots of photos!
  - itemname: Swimsuit
    description: Yes, really! A fantastic way to stay warm in Iceland is in one of
      the many geothermal hot springs.
  - itemname: Tripod
    description: One of the best reasons to visit Iceland in winter is to see the
      northern lights. Bring a tripod to make sure you get some lovely clear
      photos.
