1. **TravelPro luggage** 

We’ve both used our [TravelPro carryon luggage](https://www.amazon.com/Travelpro-Luggage-Expandable-Carry-Dusty/dp/B07XSBJJ4L/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1NJ4AMGJRY5NG&keywords=travelpro%2Bluggage&qid=1641758905&sprefix=travelpro%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWjg4RllIV0VLNjZTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjYzMzE0MTZJTVlKWVU0T1FURyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjQ3Mzk2MkI5MUYxVlY0M0dHNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1) for over five years and they have held up so well! 

2. **Packing cubes** 

I started using [packing cubes](https://www.amazon.com/TravelWise-Luggage-Packing-Organization-Medium/dp/B075M43P4G/ref=sr_1_24?crid=1J7FIRM42XVAO&keywords=packing%2Bcubes&qid=1641758962&sprefix=packing%2B%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-24&th=1) just a few years ago, but I’m a believer now. It helps to be able to separate everything you’re packing and makes it easy to unpack at your destination. 

3. **Travel wallet** 

This is a super helpful way to keep all your important documents together. I like [wallets](https://www.amazon.com/Travel-Document-Organizer-Passport-Wristlet/dp/B07QKKFY3J/ref=sr_1_30?crid=1DA43O0NLUDGY&keywords=travel+wallet&qid=1641761128&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011&rnid=2661617011&sprefix=travel+wallet%2Caps%2C81&sr=8-30) that are big enough to fit a boarding pass, passport, vaccine cards, and other documents you need to keep safe during your travels like entry/exit visas. Don’t forget to keep a pen in your wallet! You’ll need it to fill out Customs forms on international trips, or to write out a postcard to a friend!

4. **Neck pillow** 

I’m a fan of the [Trtl](https://www.amazon.com/Trtl-Pillow-Scientifically-Support-Washable/dp/B00LB7REFK/ref=sr_1_15?crid=2Q8UYA6TYBFQH&keywords=airplane+neck+pillow&qid=1641761278&sprefix=airplane+ne%2Caps%2C84&sr=8-15) style neck wrap since you can wrap it in any direction and it’s small enough to toss into my tote bag in the airport. 

5. **Scarf or shawl**

I’m typically cold in the airport and on the plane, so I always have a [pashmina wrap](https://www.amazon.com/Achillea-Large-Pashmina-Colors-Champagne/dp/B01MXVQ0CL/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1RV3EOJBTG7I1&keywords=pashmina%2Bscarf&qid=1641762734&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011&rnid=2661617011&sprefix=pashm%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-6&th=1) with me to use as a cover around my shoulders or even as a blanket. I usually take a neutral color that matches my outfits for my destination as well!

6. **Compression socks** 

[Compression socks](https://www.amazon.com/Travelsox-TSS6000-Graduated-Compression-Performance/dp/B000UQZB94/ref=sr_1_28?crid=O3QGVH8V8PNF&keywords=compression%2Bsocks%2Bfor%2Btravel&qid=1641763509&sprefix=compression%2Bsocks%2Bfor%2Bt%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-28&th=1) improve circulation and reduce leg swelling while traveling. If your socks are too tight and restricting, you probably have the wrong size. Make sure you measure your calves and find the right fit. They really do make your legs feel great!

7. **Noise canceling headphones**

I admit I’m a recent convert to [noise-canceling headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1WAA2YH10PQ7T&keywords=airpods+pro&qid=1641763851&sprefix=airp%2Caps%2C78&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSFAzWERYNllRQlFCJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTQwMTA0MktPT0o1NzlSOEhURiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDA1NDE0M1JFWVNXODNIVVpCMyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) but, wow, do they make a difference! Drown out the engine hum and noisy passengers!

8. **Portable power bank charger**

Portable [power banks](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3JS01VV3B4D6U&keywords=portable%2Bcharger&qid=1641763891&sprefix=portable%2Bcharger%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-4&th=1) are convenient when your batteries are running low on the go. We’ve charged phones, tablets, headlamps, headphones, and more with ours. It’s also useful when there are limited outlets, and you need to charge multiple devices.
