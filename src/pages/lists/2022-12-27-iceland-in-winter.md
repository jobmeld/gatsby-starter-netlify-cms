    description: While the winter temperatures in Iceland usually average 32°F, it’s
      the wind that makes it feel much colder. We like to wear a [Gore-Tex outer

      to protect against wind and water and a lightweight packable jacket takes
      up less room in your suitcase. We typically layer this over an insulated
      puffer coat or other layers depending on the temperature, but you could
      also wear a

      will reduce core heat loss to keep you warm. Most insulated jackets pack
      down pretty small within its own pocket or small stuff sack, so these are
      easy for traveling!
