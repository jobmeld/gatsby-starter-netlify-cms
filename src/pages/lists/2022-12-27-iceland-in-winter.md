  its perks for visiting in each season. If you’re planning to visit in winter,
  the key to staying warm and comfortable is layers! "
listitems:
  - itemname: Wind and Waterproof Jacket
    description: While the winter temperatures in Iceland usually average 32°F, it’s
      the wind that makes it feel much colder. We like to wear a [Gore-Tex outer
      layer](https://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-marz97k)
      to protect against wind and water and a lightweight packable jacket takes
      up less room in your suitcase. We typically layer this over an insulated
      puffer coat or other layers depending on the temperature, but you could
      also wear a
      [3-in-1](https://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-w-clementine-triclimate-jacket)
      coat as all your layers. Keep in mind that these jackets are usually
      bulkier so you may end up just wearing it on the airplane.
  - itemname: Insulated Jacket

      [jacket](https://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-stretchdown-down-jacket-mens)
      will reduce core heat loss to keep you warm. Most insulated jackets pack
      down pretty small within its own pocket or small stuff sack, so these are
      easy for traveling!
  - itemname: Fleece Jacket or Wool Sweater

      [jacket](https://www.backcountry.com/columbia-benton-springs-full-zip-fleece-jacket-womens)
      adds extra warmth. You could also save room in your suitcase and buy a
      traditional Icelandic wool sweater during your trip!
  - itemname: Windproof pants
    description: You’ll want to protect your legs from the weather as well. Jeans
      take a long time to dry when they get wet, so we recommend
      [wind](https://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-acadia-pant-mens) or
      [waterproof](https://www.amazon.com/BALEAF-Womens-Waterproof-Weather-Insulated/dp/B07JDLSRL6/ref=sr_1_28?crid=2UORQHZCT00OG&keywords=womens+winter+pants&qid=1643227183&sprefix=womens+winter+pants%2Caps%2C69&sr=8-28)
      pants as a top layer.
