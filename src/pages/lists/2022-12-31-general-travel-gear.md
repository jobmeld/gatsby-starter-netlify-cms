  - itemname: Luggage
    link: https://www.amazon.com/Travelpro-Luggage-Expandable-Carry-Dusty/dp/B07XSBJJ4L/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1NJ4AMGJRY5NG&keywords=travelpro%2Bluggage&qid=1641758905&sprefix=travelpro%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWjg4RllIV0VLNjZTJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjYzMzE0MTZJTVlKWVU0T1FURyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjQ3Mzk2MkI5MUYxVlY0M0dHNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1
    description: "We’ve used our TravelPro carry-on luggage for over five years, and
      they have held up so well! "

  - itemname: "Packing Cubes "
    description: "I started using packing cubes just a few years ago but I’m a
      believer now. It helps to separate everything you’re packing and makes it
      easy to unpack at your destination. "
    link: https://www.amazon.com/TravelWise-Luggage-Packing-Organization-Medium/dp/B075M43P4G/ref=sr_1_24?crid=1J7FIRM42XVAO&keywords=packing%2Bcubes&qid=1641758962&sprefix=packing%2B%2Caps%2C83&sr=8-24&th=1

  - itemname: Travel wallet
    description: This is a super helpful way to keep all your important documents
      together. I like wallets that are big enough to fit a boarding pass,
      passport, vaccine cards, and other documents you need to keep safe during
      your travels, like entry/exit visas. Don’t forget to keep a pen in your
      wallet! You’ll need it to fill out Customs forms on international trips or
      write a postcard to a friend!

  - itemname: "Neck pillow "
    description: "I’m a fan of the Trtl style neck wrap since you can wrap it in any
      direction, and it’s small enough to toss into my tote bag in the airport.
      "
    link: https://www.amazon.com/Trtl-Pillow-Scientifically-Support-Washable/dp/B00LB7REFK/ref=sr_1_15?crid=2Q8UYA6TYBFQH&keywords=airplane+neck+pillow&qid=1641761278&sprefix=airplane+ne%2Caps%2C84&sr=8-15
  - itemname: Scarf or shawl
    description: I’m typically cold in the airport and on the plane so I always have
      a pashmina wrap with me to use as a cover around my shoulders or even as a
      blanket. I usually take a neutral color that matches my outfits for my
      destination too!
    link: https://www.amazon.com/Achillea-Large-Pashmina-Colors-Champagne/dp/B01MXVQ0CL/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1RV3EOJBTG7I1&keywords=pashmina%2Bscarf&qid=1641762734&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011&rnid=2661617011&sprefix=pashm%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-6&th=1
  - itemname: "Compression socks "
    description: Compression socks improve circulation and reduce leg swelling while
      traveling. If your socks are too tight and restricting, you probably have
      the wrong size. Make sure you measure your calves and find the right fit.
      They do make your legs feel great!

  - itemname: Noise-canceling headphones
    description: I admit I’m a recent convert to noise-canceling headphones, but
      wow, do they make a difference! Drown out the engine hum and noisy
      passengers!
    link: https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1WAA2YH10PQ7T&keywords=airpods+pro&qid=1641763851&sprefix=airp%2Caps%2C78&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSFAzWERYNllRQlFCJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTQwMTA0MktPT0o1NzlSOEhURiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDA1NDE0M1JFWVNXODNIVVpCMyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=
  - itemname: Portable power bank charger
    description: Portable power banks are just convenient when your batteries are
      running low on the go. We’ve charged phones, tablets, headlamps,
      headphones, and more with ours. It’s also helpful when there are limited
      outlets, and you need to charge multiple devices.
